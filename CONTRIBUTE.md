# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO A$$ETH0UND?

Heya, if you want the H0und's capabilities to increase then feel free to contribute. Contributions can be made in 2 ways:-

1. **Bug fixes** - If there are any bugs within the tool then feel free to raise an issue and if you know the fix do ask first so I can assign you that issue. If there are already pending issues in the issue tab then you can contribute by fixing them as well. Remember to ask first so I can assign you. And before raising any issue do check beforehand if that same issue has been raised already.
2. **New Feature** - If you have any new feature in mind then do share them by making a PR. Check beforehand if a PR with the same feature already exists!
3. **Optimize existing feature** - You can also contribute by making the existing features better!

You can clone the repo or fork it depending on your contribution type and your ease, and after your work is done you can create a PR to this main branch. 
## The PR must have a title summarizing the contribution and also the body must contain in-depth details of the contribution in point-wise structure. Also there should not be any conflicts!

I personally prefer stability over features and hence I'll give more preference to bug fixes or optimization than a new feature additon.

## A little end note, I ain't a developer but rather a coder and so my code, although working properly, may still be "dirty". If you are a developer and your clean-code syndrome is killing you then feel free to contribute by cleaning the code to give it a more professional look!

Thank you everyone!
